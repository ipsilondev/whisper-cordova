//
// A note on the semantics of cross-device copies.
//
// There are two mechanisms to transfer a buffer from one device to another.
// When both devices are on the same host (more specifically, the user program
// ends up with pointers to both the source and destination buffers in the same
// address space), the caller can use:
//   dst_buffer = src_buffer->CopyToDevice(dst_device)
//
// When the source and destination are on different hosts, but the transfer is
// made via native device networking (as opposed to the user program fetching
// the buffer and sending it using its own networking code), the caller can
// use:
//   DstHost: dst_client->MakeCrossHostReceiveBuffers(...)
//   DstHost: [...]
//   DstHost: gets callback containing PjRtCrossHostRecvDescriptors
//   DstHost: sends cross-host recv serialized descriptors to SrcHost
//   SrcHost: src_buffer->CopyToRemoteDevice(serialized_descriptors)
//
// Note that in the cross-host case, the dst_client may call
// MakeCrossHostReceiveBuffers before the action that produces src_buffer has
// been enqueued at SrcHost.
//
// On some platforms, device-to-device transfers consume scarce hardware
// resources. If dst_client->MakeCrossHostReceiveBuffers immediately claimed
// those resources, then there would be a risk of system-wide deadlock, if the
// resources claimed by the recv prevented other transfers that are necessary
// to generate src_buffer from acquiring enough resources to proceed.
//
// In order to allow clients to avoid deadlocks such as those in the preceding
// paragraph, PjRtClient guarantees progress but not fairness with respect to
// the order that cross-device transfers are enqueued on a given host, as
// follows:
//
// The progress guarantee is that a cross-device transfer T on host A will not
// claim scarce hardware resources until it is guaranteed that all transfers
// enqueued on A before T have already either completed, or been assigned enough
// resources to ensure that they can eventually complete.
//
// The lack of a fairness guarantee means that, if cross-device transfer T1 is
// enqueued before transfer T2 at A, then T2 may complete before T1. T1 may be
// delayed for an unbounded time waiting for T2 if T2 is large, even though T1
// will eventually be able to make progress.
